Beautiful America
A Showcase of U.S. National Parks
========
A little proof-of-concept rails project that uses 500px api and google maps api to show high quality photographs for American national parks.

Known issues:

- Kobuk Valley has no pictures, Hot Springs has fewer than 3 photos, which causes gallery library to malfunction
- Place disclaimer message on bottom of showcase for 500px terms
- IE support
